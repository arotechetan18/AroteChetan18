Hi there! 👋<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I’m Chetan(@AroteChetan18), a passionate Java Software Engineer focused on building scalable, high-performance backend applications using modern Java technologies.<br><br>

My Journey 🚀<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My journey in software development started with a strong interest in core Java and object-oriented programming. Over time, I’ve worked on real-world projects using Spring Boot and Hibernate, gaining hands-on experience in building RESTful web applications.
Learning by doing and improving code quality every day is what keeps me motivated.<br><br>

What Drives Me 🏆<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I enjoy solving backend problems, designing clean APIs, and understanding how systems work behind the scenes.<br>
I believe in:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Writing clean & maintainable code .<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following SDLC best practices .<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learning from teammates and real project challenges .<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debugging an issue and finally seeing the application work smoothly is my favorite win 😄<br><br>

Tools & Technologies 🛠️<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mostly work with:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Languages:  Java (Core & Advanced), Basic JavaScript, HTML, CSS <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frameworks & Technologies: Spring Core ,Spring Boot, Hibernate (Mapping & Cache),  RESTful APIs, Microservices (Basics)<br>

*  Database :MySQL<br>
*  Concepts : OOPS, Collections Framework, Exception Handling , String Handling ,SDLC<br>
*  Tools    :Git & GitHub<br><br>

Current Focus 🔍<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Building backend applications using Spring Boot<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improving REST API design<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exploring Microservices architecture<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strengthening database and performance optimization skills<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m always open to collaboration and learning opportunities 🚀<br><br>
